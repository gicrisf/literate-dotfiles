#+title: Literate Dotfiles Readme
#+author: Giovanni Crisalfi

These are my dotfiles and scripts.

I maintain my configuration with Emacs Org-mode, editing only =dotfiles.org=; other files are generated with org-babel, then symlinked with GNU Stow.

By now, the comments are mostly written in italian, but I'm counting on translate everything in english too.

Did you find something interesting in my dots?
Why don't you help me keeping myself awake buying me a coffee?
